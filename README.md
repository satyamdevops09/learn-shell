Exit Status
Every command after execution it returns a status as a number. Number ranges from 0-255

0 - Success 1-255 - NonSuccess / Partial Success / Partial Failure

We can see the status by using $? variable

We can send our own exit status in script using exit command as exit exit-number(0-255)
